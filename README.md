# Introduce

This repository is used as gprmax for hyperbolic image recognition.

# Start

You need to install Python>=3.9 and PyTorch at first.

And you can install these:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you like to install these things yourself, please refer to the file for installation.

# To Do
